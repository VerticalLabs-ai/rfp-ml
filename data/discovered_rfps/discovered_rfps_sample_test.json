SF 1442, Solicitation, Offer, and Award - Date and time for receipt of Quotes remains the same as September 18, 2025 at 4:30 PM EST.

Special emphasis was called to the Statement of Work, specifically sections 3.1-3.4. The following questions were asked: QUESTION: Was the presence to the pre-bid meeting obligatory to participate in the bid? ANSWER: No, as you mentioned in the site visit meeting. The meeting and site visit is not mandatory, but highly encouraged. QUESTION: Is there a requirement to provide Performance and Labor Bonds for the project? ANSWER: Clause 52.228-15 Performance and Payment Bonds-Construction states Performance and Payment Bonds-Construction, are required in solicitations and contracts for construction that contain a requirement for performance and payment bonds if the resultant contract is expected to exceed $150,000. The estimated magnitude of this contract is between $25,000 and $100,000. QUESTION: What are the days and hours that the contractor will be permitted to execute construction activities? ANSWER: Monday to Friday from 8:00am to 4:30pm, excluding Federal Holidays and weekends. QUESTION: Will the NRCS employees continue to use the buildings during construction activities? ANSWER: No, the buildings will not be using by federal employees when construction. Just a couple of representatives from the federal government will be in the site receive potential customers and guide them to other location. QUESTION: Is there already an Asbestos/Lead Paint Exploratory Study for each of the premises? If not, how would you like the contractor to manage that issue? ANSWER: The Federal Government does not have information, reports, studies or documentation that provide information about Asbestos in theses buildings. If asbestos is found, it will be dealt with in accordance with the Differing Site Conditions Clause, 52.236-2 Differing Site Conditions. QUESTION: Are there drawings of the existing facilities? Are they in Computer Aided Design (CAD) format? ANSWER: Yes, the government have CAD files for these facilities but unfortunately those drawings are incomplete at this time. QUESTION: Behind building 23, there is an emergency power generator. The PVC pipe with the cable connection to the main distribution panel runs through where the future ADA concrete walkway will be located. Please instruct if the contractor will be responsible of reburying the PVC cable pipe under the concrete walkway. ANSWER: If it is strictly necessary to relocate or modify the PVC pipe to accommodate the ADA-compliant concrete walkway, then the contractor will be responsible for all related work, including reburying the pipe. This determination will depend on the final design, cost efficiency, and compliance with ADA requirements. If the existing connection can remain in place without impacting accessibility or safety, avoiding modification would be preferable. QUESTION: Behind building 23, there is a banana tree and palm tree that might be in the way of the future ADA concrete walkway. Please advise if the palm tree should be removed and disposed by the contractor or if the walkway should be redirected. ANSWER: If the removal of these plants is strictly necessary to carry out the work as proposed, then it should fall under the contractor\u2019s responsibility. However, this will ultimately depend on the design solution you propose and the overall cost efficiency of the approach. We remain open to practical recommendations that balance functionality, compliance, and budget considerations. QUESTION: The scope of work mentions that all affected Ed area should be repainted after work completion. Are the wall tiles and floor tiles going to be also replaced? If so, will the tile replacements be for the entire bathroom, or should the contractor consider tiles only for the affected areas which match the current tiles (consider current tiles are relatively old models)? ANSWER: Yes, the existing wall tiles may be replaced with solid-color tiles, as the original ones are no longer available. The new tiles do not need to extend all the way to the ceiling\u2014they can be installed up to the original footprint or match the height of the existing installation. The idea is to have a full renovated restroom that comply with ADA. Also, the current floor tiles may be included in the scope of the remodel. Since the original tiles are no longer available, the proposal may inlcude to replace them with solid-color tiles that meet ADA requirements. This approach will help ensure proper visual contrast and slip resistance, supporting accessibility and safety standards. QUESTION: We kindly request a quotation due date extension of one week. ANSWER: Unfortunately, due to the limited time remaining in the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30, and the tight timeline required to finalize the contract and implement the project, it would be very difficult to accommodate an extension. Regrettably, we are unable to grant additional time for quotation submissions. QUESTION: Is there any asbestos and lead study from these two offices that you can provide to us? ANSWER: At this time, the Federal Government has no indication of the presence of asbestos or lead in these units. Additionally, the Federal Agency that owns the buildings do not have any formal studies, assessments or report related to these materials. QUESTION: Are there plans to completely remove existing bathtubs in current bathrooms to meet the minimum clearance and accessibility measurements required by the ADA? ANSWER: Yes, the current renovation plans include the complete removal of existing bathtubs in both apartments. This decision was made to ensure the bathrooms meet the minimum clearance and accessibility standards required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). QUESTION: Will existing bathroom accessories be replaced with new ones, or are there plans to reuse them? ANSWER: To ensure full compliance with ADA standards, all existing bathroom accessories needs to be replaced with new, accessible fixtures. Reusing the current accessories may not meet the required specifications for clearance, reach range, and usability under the ADA guidelines. QUESTION: In Unit 23, the men's restroom has a 24-inch door. To meet ADA minimum requirements, it needs to be at least 32 inches wide. There is a closet next to the restroom\u2014would it be possible to remove that closet in order to expand the doorway and comply with code? ANSWER: While we recognize the importance of meeting ADA minimum requirements, this project is limited to minimal demolition activities. The removal of the adjacent closet (from Unit 23, next to the men's restroom) would constitute a major structural modification, which falls outside the approved scope of work. QUESTION: I would like to confirm whether the existing floor tiles are included in the scope of the remodel. If they are, the proposal is to replace them with solid-color tiles, as the original tiles are no longer available? ANSWER: Yes, the current floor tiles may be included in the scope of the remodel. Since the original tiles are no longer available, the proposal may inlcude to replace them with solid-color tiles that meet ADA requirements. This approach will help ensure proper visual contrast and slip resistance, supporting accessibility and safety standards. QUESTION: Would like to confirm whether the existing tiles scheduled for removal can be replaced with solid-color tiles, given that the original tiles are no longer available and whether it will be kept at the current height or brought up to the ceiling? ANSWER: Yes, the existing wall tiles may be replaced with solid-color tiles, as the original ones are no longer available. The new tiles do not need to extend all the way to the ceiling\u2014they can be installed up to the original footprint or match the height of the existing installation. QUESTION: I would like to confirm whether the bathroom doors will remain in wood material? ANSWER: While the current doors are wood, replacement materials do not need to match as long as they are durable and maintain both functionality and aesthetic standards without increasing overall project costs. QUESTION: Are there plans to retain the current dimensions of the existing emergency doors? ANSWER: No, there are no plans to modify the dimensions of the existing emergency doors. The current measurements are expected to remain. QUESTION: The parking lot for people with disabilities is currently paved, is it going to be replaced with cement or will the same pavement be left? ANSWER: At this time, the decision to retain or replace the existing pavement will depend on whether it meets ADA compliance standards. If the current paved surface satisfies accessibility requirements\u2014including slope, texture, and durability\u2014it may be left as-is, which would be more cost-efficient for the project. QUESTION: Regarding Unit 23, where the sidewalk will be built, there is currently a palm tree and a banana plant. Is it contemplated that you remove them before starting the work, or is it up to us to take care of their removal? ANSWER: If the removal of these plants is strictly necessary to carry out the work as proposed, then it should fall under the contractor\u2019s responsibility. QUESTION: In the scope of work it is indicated that the hours of the facilities are from Monday to Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. We would like to confirm if that same schedule applies to the execution of our work. Also, would it be possible to work on Saturdays and Sundays? And as for the outdoor areas of the houses, could work continue after 4:30 p.m.?\" ANSWER: All project activities must be carried out during the regular operating hours of the facility: Monday through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., excluding federal holidays. Work on Saturdays and Sundays is not permitted under any circumstances. This schedule also applies to outdoor areas\u2014no work may continue past 4:30 p.m., regardless of location. QUESTION: Parking Space Surface Does the parking space need to be asphalt or concrete? I didn\u2019t see surface specifications\u2014should we propose the surface as part of the design, or will an addendum provide minimum standards (e.g., section thickness, base/subbase, striping, drainage)? ANSWER: The existing designated accessible parking space is located at the asphalt entrance to the open garage in both offices, with an adjacent concrete side aisle. The project intends to widen this space to meet ADA accessibility standards. Due to site constraints, expansion beyond the current footprint is limited\u2014materials such as gravel may be permissible in surrounding areas, but the construction of a new large concrete or asphalt pad is not feasible. The widened portion of the parking space may incorporate a narrow strip of reinforced concrete. The back door exit ramps need to be reconstructed to meet ADA standards. A walkway that can support wheelchair traffic needs be constructed from the back door exit ramps, around both offices, to the designated parking spaces. The preferred material for this is reinforced concrete. QUESTION: Bathroom Tile Specifications Could you confirm the required tile specifications for the restroom (material, size, slip resistance, installation standards, grout type, base/wainscot details)? If specs are to be contractor-proposed, please confirm the minimum performance requirements and any referenced standards. ANSWER: BATHROOM SPECS The project seeks to meet ADA Standards with as minimum demolition as possible. The preferred finish for both the floor and walls (up to the height of the existing finish) is tile. As an alternative, painted wall finishes may be considered, provided they meet durability and maintenance expectations for an office restroom environment. Please ensure all proposed materials are accompanied by manufacturer data sheets and installation guidelines for review. Compliance with ADA accessibility guidelines and ANSI A326.3 for slip resistance Materials rated for commercial use with a PEI (Porcelain Enamel Institute) rating of III or higher Installation in accordance with ANSI and TCNA standards Warranty coverage for tile and installation workmanship (minimum 1 year) QUESTION: RFI Status Have any RFIs been submitted to date? If so, could you share the RFI log and responses or point me to where they are posted? What is the deadline and email/portal for RFI submissions? ANSWER: No RFI's have been submitted for this project. ******** A Site Visit is scheduled for Thursday, September 11, 2025 at 10:00 AM at the site********* Please attend if you are interested in this project. Refer all questions to Mitchell J.

The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Caribbean Area, requires a general contractor to perform various office improvements at two offices in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, in alignment with the standards outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Pursuant to FAR 36.101-4(b), information regarding USDA\u2019s definitization of equitable adjustments for change orders under construction contracts may be found at FAR 36.211 | USDA. USDA\u2019s procedures that apply to the definitization of equitable adjustments for change orders under construction contracts may be found in 443.304 -70. The USDA NRCS Offices in Mayaguez are located at 2200 Pedro Albizu Campos Avenue, Apartments 22, 23 & 24, Mayaguez, PR, 00680 (18.2098885, -67.1386830). The two locations are adjacent to each other, within the Tropical Agricultural Research Station at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez Campus (UPR Mayaguez). The USDA-NRCS Caribbean Area seeks to enhance accessibility within the NRCS Mayag\u00fcez Field Office (Apartment 22) and Ecological Sciences Office (Apartment 23) in alignment with the standards outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These enhancements are essential to ensure that employees and customers with disabilities have equitable access to key areas of the facility, including restrooms, emergency exit routes, and designated parking spaces. The scope of this requirement includes but is not limited to: (1) Ensuring appropriate door clearance; (2) Adjusting the configuration and functionality of restroom layouts, including the removal, disposal, replacement, and re-installation of components such as vanities, toilets, bathtubs, and wall finishes; (3) Installation of compliant signage; (4) Ensuring safe and accessible emergency exit ramps, walkways and designated parking space that meet ADA standards. Design development is also included as part of this effort to support ADA-compliant outcomes.

COMMERCIAL SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS - THESE SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FROM GOVERNMENT SOURCES. THEY MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLISHERS OR SOCIETIES OF THE APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. 6.2 Information regarding abbreviations, symbols and codes appearing on DD Form 1423 - The following information is provided to assist in understanding the intent of the requirement to provide a deliverable item to the government. The explanation of abbreviation, symbols and codes found in a block follows the block number as they appear on the DD Form 1423. Block A: Is the actual contract line item no. Block B: Is the actual collective physical list of the deliverable item(s) which are part of the total requirement of the contract/purchase order. Block C: Is the category of data required, TDP is defined in MIL-T-31000. TM is defined in Part 1X, Section B of DODI 5000.2. NAVSUP-WSS has reasoned that most DD Form 1423's included in our solicitations meet the requirement of TDP as NAVSUP-WSS does not regularly purchase only Technical Manuals without purchasing hardware and related TDP software. Therefore, most NAVSUP-WSS DD Form 1423 category code will be TDP. Block D: Is the name of the parent system, next higher assembly, or the item being purchased. Block E: Is the purchase request number, request for proposal number, invitation for bid number or another number for tracking and monitoring purposes. Block F: Is the successful offerors name and or cage code. Block G: Is the name of the individual and or the code/activity of the individual who prepared the DD Form 1423 and included the requirement in the Technical Data Package (TDP). Block H: Self explanatory. Block I: Is the name and signature of the individual who approved the content and the need for inclusion of the DD Form 1423 in the TDP. Block J: Self explanatory. Block 1: Is the Exhibit Line Item Number (ELIN). Block 2: Is the title of the data item cited in Block 4. Block 3: Is the subtitle of the data item cited in Block 4 and is used if the title requires clarification. Block 4: Is the actual Data Item Description (DID) number or the actual Technical Manual Contract Requirements Number. In the event the DD Form 1423 is requiring a technical manual the numbered TMCR will be an attachment to the contract/purchase order. Block 5: Is the section and paragraph area, where the requirement statement for the DD Form 1423 will be found. Block 6: Is the activity that will inform the contractor of approval, conditional approval or disapproval of the deliverable item. Block 7: Is a code which designates authority for inspection and acceptance of the deliverable item. The definition of the codes is as follows: DD Form 250 Code Inspection Acceptance SS (1) (2) DD (3) (4) SD (1) (4) DS (3) (5) LT (6) (7) NO (8) (8) XX (9) (9) (1) Inspection at source. (2) Acceptance at source. (3) No inspection performed at source. Final inspection performance at destination. (4) Acceptance at destination. (5) Acceptance at source. Acceptance based on written approval from the Contract Officer. (6) Letter of transmittal only. LT should not be used when inspection is required. The data is sent by the contractor directly to the personnel listed in Block 14 of the DD Form 1423. LT is used when the contracting agency does not desire to have a DD Form 250 for each and every piece of data developed by the contractor. The only other authorized use of LT is the special case where the contracting agency does not desire to have separate DD Forms 250 but desires to have a Government quality assurance representative perform inspection.

Block 14a: Will contain the activity name(s) where the deliverable item is to be sent. If the activity is other than DCMA or NAVSUP-WSS the full name, address (including code) will be specified.

Block 17: Is the block where the bidder or offeror is to enter the appropriate price group. The price groups are defined as follows: A. Group I - Data which the contractor prepares to satisfy the Government's requirements. The contractor does not need this type of data to perform the rest of the contract. Price would be based on identifiable direct costs, overhead, General and Administrative (G&A) and profit. B. Group II - Data essential to contract performance which must be reworked or amended to conform to Government requirements. The price for data in this group would be based on the direct cost to convert the original data to meet Government needs and to deliver it, plus allocable overhead, G&A and profit. C. Group III - Data which the contractor must develop for his own use and which requires no substantial change to conform to Government requirements regarding depth of content, format, frequency of submittal, preparation, and quality of data. Only the costs of reproducing, handling and delivery, plus overhead, G&A and profit, are considered in pricing data in this group. D. Group IV - Data which the contractor has developed as part of his commercial business. Not much of this data is required and the cost is insignificant. The item should normally be coded \"no charge.\" An example is a brochure or brief manual developed for commercial application which will be acquired in small quantities, and the added cost is too small to justify the expense of computing the charge that otherwise would go with the acquisition. Block 18: Enter the total estimated price equal to that portion of the total price which is estimated to be attributable to the production or development for the government of that ITEM OF DATA. THE ENTRY \"N/C\" FOR \"NO CHARGE\" is acceptable. 6.3 In accordance with DoDI 5230.24 all documents and drawings provided by the U.S. Navy to prospective Contractors must include a \"Distribution Statement\" to inform the contractor of the limits of distribution, and the safeguarding of the information contained on those documents and drawings. There are 6 (six) separate distribution statement codes used for non-classified documents and drawings.

C... distribution authorized to US Government agencies and their contractors. D... distribution authorized to DoD and DoD contractors only. E... distribution authorized to DoD Components only. F... further distribution only as directed by Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, code 09T. THE PACKAGING LABEL SHALL BE MARKED WITH THE NOMENCLATURE CITED ON THE IRPOD.

    "description": "Sixty (60) Day Extension to EP-W-18-008/68HERH19F0084\u2013 Program and Project Management Support for Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Compass Licensing and Operations and Maintenance Support Services Intent to Sole Source: NAICS Code: 541512\u2014Computer Systems Design Services. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract EP-W-18-008/68HERH19F0084 in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, as described below. EP-W-18-008/68HERH19F0084 expires on March 31, 2025. A follow on to the current task order is currently being competed. The services under this contract are critical and cannot lapse. FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services was included at task order award, however, the price of that option was not negotiated at award. The EPA intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with CGI Federal Inc., 12601 Fair Lakes Circle, Fairfax VA 22033, a modification to contract EP-W-18-008/68HERH19F0084 to extend services under this contract, not to exceed sixty (60) additional days of service, until such time that the competition for the follow-on contract for Program and Project Management Support for Office of Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) Compass Licensing and Operations and Maintenance Support Services is completed and a follow-on contract is awarded. CGI Federal Inc. currently provides Program and Project Management Support services to the EPA\u2019s OCFO, under contract EP-W-18-008/68HERH19F0084 and has provided these services and support under said contract since March of 2007. The continuity that CGI Federal Inc.\u2019s services will provide are critical to maintain the Compass Financial System and to ensure continuity of mission critical work. There are no other entities that have the capability of providing the level, breadth, and depth of support that are required by OCFO in order to continue mission critical activities with the least amount of disruption in a short period of time on a temporary basis. CGI Federal Inc. is best suited for continuing to provide the above indicated services and support for the requested Sixty (60) day extension as they have the necessary infrastructure, personnel, and supplies already in place and fully functioning. This will guarantee continuity of services for the EPA\u2019s critical mission of ensuring the continuation of the Compass Licensing, Operations, and Maintenance contract. The Government is not stating that there are no other contractors who can provide these support services. The Government understands that there are other companies that provide similar support services. The Government is instead saying that considering the short period of performance contemplated within this extension and that the five year follow on contract award will be competed amongst eligible, qualified companies, that no other contractors could transition this workload from CGI Federal Inc. and efficiently continue performance without potential reduced services, increased costs, and unnecessary risks to the Government. This sixty (60) day extension of services is not an attempt by the Government to limit competition to the incumbent contractor but to provide additional time to compete, negotiate, and award the follow-on contract. In accordance with FAR Part 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the Agency. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice will be posted for 15 days. The intent of this synopsis is to state the Government\u2019s intention to sole source this requirement and to determine if any other source(s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. All interested parties who believe they can provide the required service should: 1) fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing and submit same via FedConnect, a government web portal, within 15 days from the date of this announcement; and 2) must submit itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. Consequently, any responder(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing merely to submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored. Offerors must submit all technical questions / responses concerning this synopsis electronically through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/Fedconnect/. The synopsis, amendments, and other information related to this procurement as well as any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted on the Sam.Gov website at: www.sam.gov and the Fedconnect website at: https://www.fedconnect.net/ . For questions please contact Kimberley Church-Mathis at ChurchMathis.Kimberley@epa.gov, however, at this time phone calls related to this procurement are not being accepted.",
